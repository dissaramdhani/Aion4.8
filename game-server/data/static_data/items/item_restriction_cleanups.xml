		Here you can modify item properties, such as tradability.
		The following example enables to trade the Atreian Faithful Sword, as well as store it in account and legion warehouse:
		<cleanup id="100001748" trade="1" awh="1" lwh="1"/>

		Client must be also patched in order to remove any client restrictions, otherwise it won't allow to trade the item.
		Forbidding tradability (trade="0") however works without patching the client, although players won't see the info in the item tooltip in that 
		case.
